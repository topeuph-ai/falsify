"""Negative-conformance tests for PRML — inputs every impl MUST reject.

Each vector in spec/test-vectors/reject/reject-vectors.json is a manifest that
is structurally complete but carries a control / non-portable character (C0/C1,
U+007F, U+2028/U+2029, or U+FEFF) in a string field. The PRML reference
contract is that such a manifest MUST NOT lock — `validate_manifest` returns at
least one error and the CLI exits non-zero — rather than silently hashing a
non-portable manifest.

This guards the cross-impl control-char reject rule shipped in v0.3.6 against
silent regression: if a future change drops the rule, the manifest would lock
again and these tests would catch it. The positive suites (test_prml_vectors)
prove clean manifests still lock; together they prove the rule is *specific*.

CI failure here is a specification-level event, not a code-quality nit.
