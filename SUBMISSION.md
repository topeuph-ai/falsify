# falsify — Git for AI honesty

> Lock the claim before the data, or it didn't happen.

## Category

Developer Tools / AI Infrastructure — Anthropic "Built with Opus
4.7" hackathon, April 21–26 2026.

## Written summary (paste into submission form, 187 words)

Every week another AI product claims a metric — "94% accuracy", "sub-200ms p95", "3% hallucination rate" — that quietly evaporates under scrutiny. The claim was never falsifiable. Nobody locked the metric, the threshold, or the dataset before the experiment ran, so when the number changes nobody can say whether the model regressed, the data drifted, or the bar just got silently lowered.

Falsify is a single-file Python CLI that applies scientific pre-registration to AI claims. `falsify lock` SHA-256 hashes a canonical YAML spec — metric, threshold, direction, dataset, metric-function reference — before the experiment runs. Any silent edit afterward changes the hash; the next run exits 3 and CI refuses to produce a verdict. The honest path is `lock --force`, which writes a new audit entry. Deterministic exit codes are the API: 0 PASS, 10 FAIL, 3 tampered, 11 guard violation.

Built with Claude Opus 4.7 via Claude Code over three days: five skills, two forked-context subagents, three slash commands, one MCP server, 518 passing tests, and three self-dogfooded claims (plus one external case study) that re-verify falsify's own honesty on every CI run.

## The problem

AI teams ship claims — "our model hits 92% accuracy", "p95
latency is under 200ms", "hallucination rate is below 3%" — and
then silently edit the threshold when the claim stops holding.
There is no Git-native enforcement of pre-registration for
machine-checkable claims. Silent threshold lowering is the #1
failure mode of internal ML teams we have talked to: not malice,
just pressure. By the time anyone notices, the commit history
looks clean and the bar has quietly moved.

## What falsify does

falsify is a CLI that pre-registers each claim in a hash-locked
YAML spec before the experiment runs. Threshold, direction,
dataset path, and metric-function reference are sealed in
canonical YAML and SHA-256 hashed. Any silent edit changes the
hash; any run against a tampered spec exits with code 3. CI
gates on deterministic exit codes (0 PASS, 10 FAIL, 3 hash
mismatch, 11 guard violation). The honest path — explicit
`--force` relock plus a visible audit entry — is fast; the
dishonest path is blocked at run time by the hash mismatch.

## Why it matters for Opus 4.7

Claude Code is already being used to generate and evaluate ML
claims every day. falsify gives Claude — and humans working with
Claude — a shared discipline tool: the model can draft a
falsifiable spec through the `hypothesis-author` skill, a
forked-context subagent can audit every claim against the full
verdict store paraphrase-aware, a slash command can scaffold the
full lock-run-verdict lifecycle, and an MCP server lets every
Claude session query live verdicts across the repo. Opus 4.7's
1M-token context makes each of those moves a single-pass
reasoning operation rather than a retrieval dance. This is what
pre-registration looks like when AI writes the experiments.

## Scope delivered

- 90+ commits, 3 days of pair-programming with Claude Opus 4.7.
- 518 tests across 65 files, all passing. 1 intentionally
  skipped (Python 3.11-only pyproject parity).
- 18 CLI subcommands — init, lock, run, verdict, guard, list,
  stats, diff, hook, doctor, version, export, verify, replay,
  why, trend, score, bench.
- 5 Claude skills (`hypothesis-author`, `falsify`, `claim-audit`,
  `claim-review`, `falsify-ci-doctor`) plus 2 forked-context
  subagents (`claim-auditor`, `verdict-refresher`).
- 3 Claude Code slash commands (`/new-claim`, `/audit-claims`,
  `/ship-verdict`).
- 1 MCP server with 4 tools (`list_verdicts`, `get_verdict`,
  `get_stats`, `check_claim`) and 3 resource URIs, real
  `mcp.server.Server` SDK wiring with lazy import.
- 2 Managed Agents deployment manifests (scheduled + on-demand).
- 5 claim templates (`accuracy`, `latency`, `brier`,
  `llm-judge`, `ab`) via `falsify init --template`.
- `pre-commit` framework integration — consumer-facing
  `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` plus local `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Docker reproducible-environment image (`make docker-build`).
- Self-dogfooded: 3 locked claims about falsify's own
  properties (`cli_startup`, `test_coverage_count`,
  `claude_surface`) re-verified on every CI run. Honesty score
  1.00.

## 30-second reproduction

    git clone https://github.com/studio-11-co/falsify
    cd falsify-hackathon
    pip install -e .
    falsify init --template accuracy
    falsify lock accuracy
    falsify run accuracy
    falsify verdict accuracy   # exit 0 = PASS

Repo lives at `github.com/studio-11-co/falsify`.

## The money shot

Edit the locked `spec.yaml` to lower the threshold. Run again.
The CLI exits 3 — hash mismatch — and refuses to produce a
verdict against a tampered spec. The lie is blocked
automatically. The honest correction is `falsify lock --force`,
which produces a new hash and a visible audit entry recoverable
via `falsify export`. That single workflow is the difference
between a test suite (asserts after the fact) and a claim
contract (sealed before the fact).

## What falsify is NOT

- Not a metric tracker. Use MLflow, W&B, or Neptune.
- Not a data versioner. Use DVC, Pachyderm, or LakeFS.
- Not a publication platform. Use OSF or AsPredicted.
- Not a test framework. Use pytest or your language's
  equivalent.
- falsify is a discipline tool for claim contracts — it composes
  with every tool above rather than replacing any of them.

## Known gaps

- Bayesian and sequential stopping rules are planned for 0.3.0.
  Current stopping-rule support is fixed-n plus manual review.
  See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
- Filesystem-level tampering (`rm -rf .falsify/`) is explicitly
  out of scope. Falsify is a discipline tool, not a zero-trust
  system. See [`docs/ADVERSARIAL.md`](docs/ADVERSARIAL.md).
- Single-file `falsify.py` by design; a plugin architecture for
  custom hashers or canonicalizers is not planned — the SHA-256
  invariant is load-bearing.
- MCP server requires the `mcp` Python SDK; degrades gracefully
  to a clear exit-2 hint when the extra is not installed. Plain
  helpers import without it for unit tests.

## Built with Opus 4.7

Every line of code in this repo was written with Claude Opus 4.7
via Claude Code over 3 days of pair-programming. 90+ commits, 518
tests, one-shot composition of a CLI, a forked-context subagent
layer, an MCP server, and a full documentation set. The
development loop itself was a demonstration of what this project
advocates: Claude proposed changes; locks were applied to every
self-claim before any run; CI gated on deterministic verdicts;
regressions were caught before merge. Every commit carries a
`Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.
