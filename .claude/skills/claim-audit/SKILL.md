# claim-audit

Lightweight in-session text auditor. Runs a fast keyword + regex pass
over arbitrary text — commit messages, README sections, PR descriptions,
release notes, tweets — and cross-references any empirical claim it
finds against the verdict log at `.falsify/*/verdict.json`.

This skill is the *first-pass* filter. It's deliberately cheap: string
matching on metric names, numeric thresholds, and negation cues. When
that's enough, you get a clean table and move on. When it isn't — too
many claims, paraphrases, or low-confidence matches — the skill hands
off to the `claim-auditor` subagent, which does the semantic reasoning.

## When to activate

Fire this skill when the user presents text that is about to become
part of a visible artifact — a commit, a PR body, a README edit, a
release note, an external post — and asks for a sanity check before
it goes out.

Typical openings:

- *"audit this claim"*, *"can you check this text?"*
- *"is this accurate against what we've actually measured?"*
- *"lint this commit message before I push"*
- *"review this PR description"*
- *"does this match our verdicts?"*
- *"fact check against falsify"*

Do *not* fire when:

- The user is writing code or prose that makes no empirical claims.
- No `.falsify/` directory exists in the repo — there's nothing to
  check against; point the user at `falsify init` instead.
- The user has already run `falsify guard` on the same text — guard
  covers the coarse case; escalate to the `claim-auditor` subagent if
  they want depth.

## Workflow

Execute in order; stop as soon as you have enough signal to emit the
table.

1. **Load the verdict log.** Use `Glob` to find every
   `.falsify/*/verdict.json`. For each file, read it and also read
   the sibling `.falsify/<name>/spec.yaml` to recover the full claim
   text. Build an in-memory table keyed by spec name with: claim
   text, `metric`, `direction`, `threshold`, `verdict` state (`PASS`
   / `FAIL` / `INCONCLUSIVE`), and `checked_at`. Compute `STALE` for
   any verdict whose `checked_at` is more than 7 days old.

2. **Scan the input text for empirical claims.** Three cheap passes:
   - **Numeric thresholds.** Regex `\d+(\.\d+)?%?` pulls every
     number in the text. Each hit is a candidate claim anchor.
   - **Metric keyword match.** For each loaded spec, check whether
     its `metric` name (e.g. `accuracy`, `brier_score`, `recall`)
     appears as a whole word in the text. If yes, link the numeric
     anchor to that spec.
   - **Negation cues.** Scan for *"not"*, *"doesn't"*, *"no longer"*,
     *"regress"*, *"below"* / *"above"* / *"under"* / *"over"*.
     These flip the effective direction of a claim and are needed to
     match paraphrases like *"error rate below 0.15"* against a spec
     tracking accuracy above 0.85.

3. **Rank each match by confidence.**
   - **HIGH** — metric name *and* a compatible numeric threshold
     both appear, and direction aligns with the spec.
   - **MED**  — metric name present, threshold missing or off by a
     small amount, or direction implicit.
   - **LOW**  — a claim-shaped sentence exists with no obvious
     anchor in the loaded specs. Could be UNSUPPORTED, could be a
     paraphrase only semantic reasoning will catch.

4. **Emit the table** (see next section). Record each extracted
   claim with its matched spec, the verdict state, and the
   confidence level.

5. **Decide whether to escalate.** If any of the following hold,
   recommend the `claim-auditor` subagent for a deeper pass:
   - more than two candidate claims;
   - any row marked LOW confidence;
   - the text reads like a paraphrase of a spec rather than a
     literal restatement;
   - the input is long (> ~30 lines of prose) — regex coverage is
     naturally shallow past that.

## Output format

Emit a compact Markdown table, one row per extracted claim, followed
by a single-line verdict:

```
| Input claim                              | Matched spec         | Verdict state | Confidence |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|------------|
| "accuracy above 90%"                     | acc_spec             | PASS          | HIGH       |
| "brier score below 0.25"                 | calibration                 | PASS          | HIGH       |
| "it always works"                        | —                    | —             | LOW        |

✅ 2/3 claims match a PASS verdict. 1 claim unsupported — consider handing off to the `claim-auditor` subagent for semantic review, or register it with `falsify init`.
```

Verdict-line legend:

- **✅** — every claim in the text lines up with a fresh PASS verdict.
- **⚠️** — there's at least one UNSUPPORTED, STALE, or LOW-confidence
  row. The text isn't wrong; it isn't backed either.
- **❌** — at least one row is marked CONTRADICTS (matched spec has a
  FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE verdict). Strongly recommend blocking whatever
  action the text was being prepared for.

If the text contains no empirical claims, output a single line:
*"No empirical claims detected — nothing to audit."*

## Hand-off to claim-auditor subagent

The keyword pass misses paraphrases. When the scan returns `>2` claims,
any LOW-confidence row, or suspected paraphrasing, invoke the
`claim-auditor` subagent via the `Task` tool and pass the full input
text plus the loaded verdict summary as context. The subagent does
the semantic cross-reference this skill deliberately skips.

Make the handoff explicit in the output so the user sees the chain of
responsibility:

> "⚠️ Confidence is LOW on 2 of 4 rows — paraphrases suspected.
> Escalating to the `claim-auditor` subagent for a semantic pass…"

Don't duplicate work: when you escalate, stop emitting your own table
and let the subagent's richer output stand.

## Examples

### (a) README line: HIGH-confidence PASS

> **User:** Lint this README sentence before I merge:
> *"Our retrieval reranker maintains accuracy above 90%."*
>
> **Assistant:** *(loads `.falsify/*/verdict.json`; matches `acc_spec`
> with `metric=accuracy`, `direction=above`, `threshold=0.90`,
> `verdict=PASS`, `checked_at=1d old`)*
>
> | Input claim                                  | Matched spec | Verdict state | Confidence |
> |----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
> | "accuracy above 90%"                         | acc_spec     | PASS          | HIGH       |
>
> ✅ 1/1 claim matches a PASS verdict. Safe to merge.

### (b) Tweet draft: UNSUPPORTED

> **User:** Audit this tweet: *"our new agent always works on edge cases"*
>
> **Assistant:** *(no spec matches "always works on edge cases")*
>
> | Input claim                                  | Matched spec | Verdict state | Confidence |
> |----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
> | "it always works on edge cases"              | —            | —             | LOW        |
>
> ⚠️ UNSUPPORTED. There's no locked spec backing this claim. Either
> register a falsifiable hypothesis first
> (`python3 falsify.py init edge-case-coverage`, then the
> `hypothesis-author` skill), or soften the language before posting.
