# Falsification Engine — 3-Minute Demo

## Hands-off option

Run `./demo.sh` for an auto-narrated walkthrough that runs the full
PASS → tamper → FAIL → guard-block story end-to-end and restores the
fixture when it's done. Everything below is the manual version if
you want to pace the demo yourself.

## What you'll see

Pre-registration + CI for AI-agent claims: lock a hypothesis, run the
experiment, get a deterministic PASS/FAIL verdict, and let `guard`
block any later text that contradicts the result.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- `pip install pyyaml` (inside a venv if your system blocks global pip)
- Clone this repo, `cd` into it.

## Step 1 — Lock a hypothesis (calibration sample)

```bash
mkdir -p .falsify/calibration
cp examples/calibration_sample/spec.yaml .falsify/calibration/spec.yaml
python3 falsify.py lock calibration
```

Expected:

```
✓ Locked calibration @ 97c1b9bc4a8c
  claim: brier_score below 0.25
```

The spec's canonical YAML is SHA-256 hashed and stored in
`.falsify/calibration/spec.lock.json`. Any semantic edit to `spec.yaml`
after this invalidates the lock and blocks `run` with exit 3.

## Step 2 — Run the experiment

```bash
python3 falsify.py run calibration
```

Expected:

```
✓ Run 20260421T184500_000000Z (0.05s)
```

`experiment.command` executed with a 5-minute timeout; stdout, stderr,
a copy of the lock, and a metadata file (host, python version,
duration, return code) are written under
`.falsify/calibration/runs/<timestamp>/`. The run is reproducible from those
artifacts alone.

## Step 3 — Get the verdict

```bash
python3 falsify.py verdict calibration
```

Expected:

```
Verdict: PASS
  observed brier_score = 0.214265
  threshold: below 0.25
```

The `metric_fn` (`examples.calibration_sample.metric:brier_score`) was
imported and checked against the locked criterion. PASS → exit 0,
FAIL → exit 10. `verdict.json` is written so downstream tools
(`list`, `guard`, the `claim-auditor` subagent) can read it without
re-running the experiment.

## Step 4 — Dashboard (list)

```bash
python3 falsify.py list
```

Expected:

```
NAME  LOCKED        LAST RUN                 VERDICT  OBSERVED
calibration  97c1b9bc4a8c  20260421T184500_000000Z  PASS     0.214265
```

For CI or scripts, `python3 falsify.py list --json` emits the same
data as a JSON array.

## Step 5 — Guard (CI) and the commit-msg hook

```bash
# Scan mode: non-zero if any claim is FAIL or STALE (> spec drift).
python3 falsify.py guard

# Text mode: block affirmative language that contradicts a logged verdict.
python3 falsify.py guard "we've proven the model predictions is well-calibrated"
```

Because the calibration verdict is PASS, the text call exits 0 — the
affirmative language matches a *passing* claim. If the latest verdict
had been FAIL or INCONCLUSIVE, the same sentence would have exited
11 with a `BLOCKED:` breakdown on stderr.

Install the hook so every commit gets the same check automatically:

```bash
python3 falsify.py hook install
```

Installs the commit-msg guard; backs up any pre-existing hook.
Now a commit message that asserts a falsified claim is rejected
before it enters history — the same mechanism CI uses on every push.

## Bonus — health check

```bash
python3 falsify.py doctor
```

End-to-end diagnostic — what's OK, what needs attention.

## Bonus — detect a tampered spec

```bash
sed -i 's/threshold: 0.25/threshold: 0.20/' .falsify/calibration/spec.yaml
python3 falsify.py diff calibration
```

diff proves the spec was tampered with — you see exactly what changed
before re-locking. Exit 3 on any drift; `--force` required to relock.

## Bonus — see all verdicts at once

```bash
python3 falsify.py stats
python3 falsify.py stats --json
python3 falsify.py stats --html > dashboard.html && open dashboard.html
```

One-shot dashboard across every locked spec in `.falsify/` — name,
state, metric, observed value, threshold, sample size, age in days.
Aggregate counts on the last line. The JSON form is CI-friendly;
the `--html` form is a self-contained dark-mode-aware page for
demos and quick browser review (no external assets).

## Bonus — audit trail

```bash
python3 falsify.py export > audit.jsonl
wc -l audit.jsonl
```

One JSON line per event (lock / verdict; add `--include-runs` for
run records too). Append-only. Deterministic — same `.falsify/`
contents produce byte-identical output. Share with a peer to
reproduce your verdicts from nothing but this file plus the
original `spec.yaml`.

## Bonus — project-wide honesty score

```bash
python3 falsify.py score
python3 falsify.py score --format shields
```

A single number across every claim in `.falsify/`. The shields
form is a JSON endpoint you can drop straight into your README
for a live badge that turns red when claims start failing.

## Bonus — spotting drift

```bash
python3 falsify.py trend calibration
```

ASCII sparkline of the metric across every recorded run, with the
threshold line marked and the trajectory classified (`improving` /
`degrading` / `flat` / `mixed`). Useful for catching a slow
regression before it tips a claim into FAIL.

## Bonus — explaining a verdict

```bash
python3 falsify.py why calibration
```

Output (STALE case, right after someone edits the spec without
re-locking):

```
claim: calibration
state: STALE
reasoning: the spec has been edited (sha256:1038219d75a8) but no run
  exists against this hash. Last run was against sha256:164f619d4860.
locked: yes (sha256:164f619d4860, 2h ago)
last run: 2026-04-22T02:10:17+00:00 (2h ago)
next action: `falsify run <name>` to produce a fresh verdict against
  the current spec.
```

Verdict tells you PASS/FAIL; `why` tells you *why* — and, more
importantly, what the next honest action is. Always exits 0.

## Bonus — proving reproducibility

```bash
python3 falsify.py replay <run-id>
```

Runs the metric again against the same dataset. Exits 0 only if
the number matches bit-for-bit (or within `--tolerance`) — the
claim isn't just locked, it's reproducible.

## Bonus — verify a peer's audit trail

```bash
python3 falsify.py verify audit.jsonl
```

Walks the JSONL and checks that each verdict's `locked_hash` chains
back to a preceding lock's `canonical_hash`, that timestamps are
monotonic per spec, and that no records were reordered. If anyone
tampered with the file after export, the hash chain breaks and
verify refuses it with exit 10.

## Self-measuring

```bash
python3 falsify.py bench --runs 3
```

Spawns each of `init`, `--help`, `list`, `stats`, `score` under a
fresh temp directory and prints per-command latency (min / median
/ p95 / max / mean / stddev). Handy as a "did we regress startup
time?" sanity check before a release.
