# PRML v0.1 conformance suite

Run any PRML implementation against the 13 canonical test vectors and report whether it produces byte-equivalent canonical bytes and matching SHA-256 hashes.

## Quick start

```bash
# Sanity-check the reference Python implementation
python3 conform.py "python3 reference-target.py"

# Test your implementation
python3 conform.py "/path/to/your/prml-binary"
python3 conform.py "node dist/cli.js conform"
python3 conform.py "go run ./cmd/falsify-conform"
python3 conform.py "cargo run --bin falsify-conform --release --quiet"
```

Expected output for a conforming implementation:

```
PRML v0.1 conformance — 13 vectors
target: python3 reference-target.py
file:   test-vectors.json

  PASS  TV-001  Minimal valid manifest
  PASS  TV-002  Key ordering — random insertion order
  ...
  PASS  TV-012  MAE for regression
  PASS  TV-013  Integer-valued threshold

PASS — 13/13 passed
```

Exit codes:

- `0` — all 13 vectors pass
- `1` — one or more failures (details printed)
- `2` — runner / IO error

## Protocol for the target binary

Your implementation must:

1. Read a single JSON object from **stdin** (the manifest fields)
2. Canonicalise it according to PRML v0.1 §4
3. Compute SHA-256 over the UTF-8 bytes of the canonical form
4. Write **a single JSON object** to stdout:

```json
{
  "canonical": "<canonical bytes as utf-8 string>",
  "hash": "<sha256 hex, no prefix>"
}
```

5. Exit with code `0` on success, non-zero on error

The runner times out at 10 seconds per vector. If your implementation needs longer than that to canonicalise a small YAML object, something is wrong.

### A reference target

[`reference-target.py`](reference-target.py) is a 40-line Python implementation that satisfies the protocol. Use it to sanity-check your runner setup, then swap in your own.

## What "byte-equivalent" means

The runner compares two things per vector:

1. **`canonical` strings** — character-by-character. Trailing newlines, line endings, key ordering, quoting — all must match.
2. **`hash` strings** — exact match (case-sensitive hex).

If `hash` matches but `canonical` differs, you have a bug that *happens* to round-trip to the same hash. That's worse than a hash mismatch — fix it.

If `canonical` matches but `hash` differs, your hashing function is broken (wrong algorithm, wrong encoding, wrong byte handling).

## Common failure modes

### Key ordering

PRML v0.1 §4 mandates lexicographic key ordering. Many languages' default YAML emitters preserve insertion order. Force sorted output:

- Python (PyYAML): `yaml.safe_dump(d, sort_keys=True)`
- JS (js-yaml): `yaml.dump(d, { sortKeys: true })`
- Go (gopkg.in/yaml.v3): wrap in `MarshalSorted` (custom)
- Rust (serde_yaml): use `serde_yaml::to_string` with a `BTreeMap`

### Unicode handling

The runner's `TV-005` includes a Unicode dataset hash field. Implementations must emit Unicode characters directly (not as `\xFC` escapes). For PyYAML: `allow_unicode=True`.

### Float formatting

`threshold: 0.85` and `threshold: 0.850` are different bytes. The reference impl uses Python's default float repr. JS / Go / Rust emit floats slightly differently — the test vectors include canonical float forms; match them.

### Trailing newline

The canonical form ends with exactly one `\n`. Two trailing newlines, no trailing newline, or `\r\n` will all fail.

## Adding new test vectors

We accept proposed new vectors via PR to this repo. Each vector must:

1. Have a `id` of the form `TV-NNN` (next available)
2. Include `title`, `description`, `input`, `canonical`, `hash`
3. Be reproducible: someone running the reference target on `input` must produce `canonical` and `hash` exactly

Do not modify existing vectors. The 13 v0.1 vectors are immutable; we use them to verify the spec hasn't drifted.

## Versioning

This suite covers PRML v0.1 only. v0.2 adds optional fields (streaming variant, runner attestation, revocation) — its conformance suite will be at `spec/test-vectors/v0.2/CONFORMANCE.md` once v0.2 freezes.

A v0.2-conforming impl MUST pass all v0.1 vectors. This is non-negotiable; v0.2 is fully backwards-compatible at the hash level for v0.1-shaped manifests. See [v0.2 RFC](https://spec.falsify.dev/v0.2-rfc) for details.
