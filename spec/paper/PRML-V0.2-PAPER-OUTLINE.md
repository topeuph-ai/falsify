## Abstract (target ≤ 200 words)

> PRML v0.1 (Öztürk, 2026) introduced a content-addressed YAML serialisation that binds a pre-registered ML evaluation claim to a SHA-256 hash. The format covered the canonical case — a single batch evaluation against a fixed threshold — and deliberately deferred three classes of claim: live streaming evaluations, post-publication retractions, and runtime execution attestation. v0.2, frozen on 2026-05-22 after a 14-day public comment window, addresses these gaps additively. We introduce four optional fields (`prml_mode`, `value_method`, `runner_attestation`, `revoked_at` / `revocation_reason`) and one structural change (the patent non-assertion grant moves from the appendix into the preamble). Every v0.1 manifest remains a valid v0.2 manifest, and the canonicalisation rules preserve hash-equivalence for v0.1-shaped inputs across the four reference implementations. We report the 27 substantive comments received during the RFC window, the 11 changes incorporated and 16 deferred, and a calibration study against the 12 v0.1 conformance vectors plus 8 new v0.2 vectors. The spec is licensed CC BY 4.0; the reference implementations are MIT; the patent non-assertion grant is reproduced verbatim in §1.5.

## Section structure

### §1 Introduction (≈2 pages)

- §1.1 What v0.1 closed and what it left open (3 paragraphs)
- §1.2 Three motivating cases that arose during the v0.1 launch
  - A live Elo-style evaluation that did not fit `prml_mode: static`
  - A post-publication dataset contamination event with no in-spec retraction path
  - A federally-funded audit that asked "what was actually run?" rather than "what was committed?"
- §1.3 Contributions
- §1.4 Non-goals — explicitly preserved from v0.1
- §1.5 Patent non-assertion grant (moved here per CEN-CENELEC P-05; full text)

### §2 Background and related work — minimal updates from v0.1 (≈1.5 pages)

- §2.1 Updates to "Pre-registration in adjacent fields" — referencing the JTC 21 / EU AI Act Article 12 mapping work that landed during the v0.1 cycle
- §2.2 New: "Streaming evaluation primitives" — survey of how Chatbot Arena, AlpacaEval live, and production A/B systems handle the threshold-commitment question (or fail to)
- §2.3 New: "Retraction in cryptographic commitment systems" — brief: how transparency logs (Sigstore/Rekor), Certificate Transparency, and software supply-chain (in-toto) handle revocation; what PRML's narrower scope adopts and what it doesn't
- §2.4 Cross-reference to v0.1 paper for unchanged background (compute, content-addressed systems)

### §3 The four v0.2 additions (≈4 pages — the meat)

For each addition: motivation paragraph → schema diff → byte-level canonicalisation rule → worked example → known limit.

- §3.1 P-01: Streaming variant (`prml_mode`, `value_method`, `pre_registered_from/to`, `sample_size` as minimum)
  - Worked example: 30-day Chatbot Arena window, Elo aggregation rule
  - Limit: streaming hash commits the *protocol*, not the *answer*; consequence for verification
- §3.2 P-02: Runner attestation (`runner_attestation` URI)
  - Worked example: Sigstore-attested runner emitting a Rekor log entry
  - Limit: PRML records that an attestation was emitted, not what it contains
- §3.3 P-03: Revocation primitive (`revoked_at`, `revocation_reason` controlled vocab)
  - Worked example: dataset_compromised retraction on a published manifest
  - Limit: revocation is signal, not authority — the original hash continues to verify
- §3.4 P-04: Conformance vector format
  - The directory layout, the runner protocol (stdin JSON → stdout JSON)
  - 8 new v0.2 vectors named and cited from `spec/test-vectors/v0.2/`
  - Coverage analysis: which v0.2 features each vector exercises

### §4 Backwards compatibility (≈1 page)

- §4.1 The non-negotiable property: any v0.1 manifest produces the same hash under v0.2 canonicalisation rules
- §4.2 Empirical check: all 12 v0.1 vectors run against the patched v0.2 reference implementations; results table
- §4.3 What this rules out: any v0.2 change that requires re-canonicalising v0.1 inputs is rejected at design time

### §5 The RFC process itself (≈2 pages — methodological)

- §5.1 Process: 14-day public comment window, GitHub issues + email, daylight rule (no off-record discussion changes the spec)
- §5.2 Comment volume and disposition
  - Total comments received
  - Per-proposal breakdown (P-01 through P-05)
  - Adopted: N. Modified: M. Deferred to v0.3+: K. Rejected as out-of-scope: J.
- §5.3 What changed between RFC and final v0.2 — annotated diff
- §5.4 Open question: was the 14-day window long enough? Empirical reading of comment-arrival distribution.

### §6 Implementation report (≈1.5 pages)

- §6.1 Patches to falsify (Python), prml-js (Node), prml-go, prml-rust
- §6.2 Lines of diff per implementation
- §6.3 Conformance test results: 12 v0.1 vectors + 8 v0.2 vectors against each impl
- §6.4 Inspect AI upstream RFC status
- §6.5 falsify-inspect adapter — operating below the upstream change in case it doesn't land

### §7 Threat model — updates only (≈1 page)

- §7.1 New attack surfaces introduced by streaming mode (window-rolling, eval timing manipulation)
- §7.2 New attack surfaces introduced by revocation (selective revocation as quiet retraction)
- §7.3 What PRML still doesn't defend against — selective publication still stands as the §8.1 limit, now §9.1

### §8 Compliance mapping — updates (≈1 page)

- §8.1 EU AI Act Article 12 mapping: how runner_attestation field interacts with 12(2)(b) traceability
- §8.2 ISO/IEC 42001:2023 — updated clause references
- §8.3 NIST AI RMF — Govern.5.2 updates per v0.2 revocation primitive
- §8.4 JTC 21 input — status of the comment paper submitted 2026-05-15

### §9 Limitations (preserved from v0.1, expanded) (≈1 page)

- §9.1 Selective publication (preserved verbatim from v0.1 §8.1)
- §9.2 Bit-level float determinism (deferred to v0.3 with tolerance field)
- §9.3 Multi-claim manifests (still single-claim per manifest; composition is a registry concern)
- §9.4 Algorithm agility (sha256 only in v0.2; post-quantum migration is v0.3+)
- §9.5 Runner attestation does not specify what makes an attestation valid

### §10 Discussion (≈1 page)

- §10.1 What we learned from the v0.1 launch about distribution
- §10.2 Why "additive only" mattered — and what it cost (rejected ideas summary)
- §10.3 The integrity index pattern — what surfacing format-hygiene scores publicly did
- §10.4 RFC-process implications for future ML standards

### §11 Conclusion (≈0.5 pages)

Same shape as v0.1 conclusion: the cost of adoption is one hash function call; the cost of non-adoption is the gap that v0.1 named and v0.2 closes by addition. v0.2 is fully backwards-compatible. We invite the community to adopt the format in publication and audit pipelines. v0.3 freeze is targeted for early 2027.

### Appendices

- A. Updated canonical-bytes ABNF grammar (v0.2 fields)
- B. Updated ISO/IEC 42001:2023 clause-by-clause mapping
- C. The 8 new v0.2 conformance vectors (verbatim with hashes)
- D. The full RFC comment archive (from `spec.falsify.dev/v0.2-comments`)

## Constraints

- **Voice rule (preserved from v0.1):** straightforward, no marketing register. The paper documents a primitive; it does not advocate for adoption beyond what the math supports.
- **Citation rule:** every claim about external systems (Inspect, HELM, JTC 21) must cite a public artefact, not informal communication.
- **Honesty rule:** the RFC comment volume is what it is. If only 5 substantive comments arrived, report 5. Do not pad with our own questions.
- **Scope rule:** if a topic exceeds the page budget, defer to a follow-up paper rather than truncate.

---

## Open authorship questions

1. Should the integrity-index methodology paper be a separate venue submission or an appendix here? Default: separate (different audience).
2. Should the JTC 21 comment paper be referenced inline or attached as supplementary? Default: referenced inline; supplementary materials grow out of hand fast.
3. Should `falsify-inspect` get its own paper at a tools track? Plausible but low priority; mention in §6.4 and revisit only if Inspect upstream lands.
